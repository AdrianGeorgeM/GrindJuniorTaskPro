# Grind Task

Welcome to the Grind Task project. To begin, please follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Node.js must be installed on your system.
- You should have either npm or yarn installed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
cd GrindJuniorTaskPro
```

3. Install all the necessary project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# Alternatively, you can use yarn:
# yarn install
```

## Compiling Sass to CSS

To compile the Sass code into CSS, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build-css
# Or, if you prefer yarn:
# yarn build-css
```

This command will continuously monitor changes in the `src/scss/main.scss` file and compile it into `public/main.css`.

4. To run the project, you have a few options. You can utilize a development server of your choice (e.g., Live Server for HTML files), or you can directly open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
